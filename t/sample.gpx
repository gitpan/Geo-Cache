This was my first. Grabbed the travel bug to take west. Took the eyeglass repiar kit and left an Exacto knife kit. This is a nice cache and a short walk in the woods. Wouldn't want to do at night withoout a good light. Thanks

Let me say this... if you are a novice hunter: save this one for the daytime.[:D]  Hunted this one on Sunday evening on the way back from being down in Southern IL.  To say we got a start on this cache would be just a little understated.

MamaICQ fell*ouch*, screamed, ripped the leg of her pants and bruised her leg and knee.  We don't know if that's why the 4-wheeler visitors seemed to be looking for us or not.  We ended up (because of the 4-wheelers) deciding to walk out in the dark with no flashlights.

Mama and Papa ICQ headed back (Feb 24) to make sure the cache was in order and hidden good(since we left in such a hurry).

Took: Squirrel keychain
      $10 (Thanks mike_anderson1492)

Left: Thermal foot warmers
      Thermal hand warmers
      Grubbmoor's (ZBQ) travel coin
      Eyeglasses repair kit

That was a laugh!  My own cache hiding from me!
Went back this morning and found it.
Cache is in good shape - nice and dry - in spite of being snow covered and frozen in place.  There must have been quite a lot of snow there.

Next finder needs to check the log carefully...:-).

I was within pecking distance from the turkey before it freaked out (ok, we both freaked out) LOL. I squealed like a girl and it gobbled like a...um...well I guess like a freaked out turkey.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene in central Illinois on the chilly first weekend of February. We had a little disagreement with a train about how we should get to this cache; the train won, we took another route, and by the time we got to the area again, the train had moved on anyway [;)].

This has been a day of cemeteries, what with all the pieces of [I]Grave Decisions[/I] that we visited, and now another cemetery! We had the place to ourselves (as far as we could tell) and parked in a convenient spot near the creek. After crossing the creek, when we stopped to check out GPSr readings, we were only about six feet from where the cache was hiding, well-hidden by the snow, of course. Mean Gene spotted it anyway, and the hunt was over. Thanks, mudhen4x4! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching with roelsch on a cold, windy, overcast, snowy, icy, and otherwise perfect day for caching.  We approached from the north and encountered a train stopped on the tracks and blocking our path.  Using our map we plotted a new route.  After a ten-minute drive we realized that we only needed to go east one block.  We parked close to the cache and found the way across the creek.  Using the name of the cache as a clue we searched in the correct spot.  The cache was completely covered in snow and ice but was still a relatively easy find.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.  Thanks, mudhen4x4, for placing this cache.  – Mean Gene, St. Louis MO</groundspeak:text>

There are some items to trade in the cache if you want.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There is an interesting tree down by the river.  See the photos.

My GPS was playing tricks for a couple of caches, leading me 100 or more feet away from where Mean Genes GPS was taking him. This was one of them, and we took markedly different routes to get to the cache. After this cache I powered the GPS down and up again, and things seemed to get better. TNLN. Thanks, martin67!

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching with roelsch on a sunny Saturday trip through central Illinois.  We found the correct side road and stopped just up the hill from the spillway.  There was a fisherman parked farther down the hill.  We had actually parked abeam of the cache but walked down and tried to circle around but ran into some thick foliage.  I circled back around and roelsch bushwhacked (I am usually the one that does that) up the hill and we met at the cache.  The cache container was open and full of water.  Fortunately, the logbook was in a new zip lock bag and was bone dry.  We poured out the water and re-hid the cache.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.  Thanks, martin67, For placing this cache.  - Mean Gene and the Rooter St. Louis MO</groundspeak:text>

Nice little hike to the cache and you're right, the terrain does get a little tougher nearer the cache. Nice hid and goodies in the cache. We (especially RGS)had a special bonus. RGS had left some 'geocards' in some of his caches in St. Louis well over a year or so ago, and one of them had traveled to this cache!!! (As he explained to me, it was sort of like a travel bug)Fun to find that!!! Thanks.</groundspeak:text>

If it had been raining we would have needed a bridge to cross some of the erosion channels. WOW.  Found the cache and left the shuttlecraft Berman.  Starfeet will probably be upset that we left it behind but they will have to get over it.

I have a friend and fellow Geocacher that collects these little micromachine startrek ships.  The full set is worth, are you setting down, over $800.  Some of these little plastic toys bring over $100 on ebay (not the shuttlecraft 
Berman though).

Took the emergency rain poncho.  This will go nicely with my emergency blanket I got yesterday.

Looked over the list of caches in the area and realized I was about 17 miles from this one.  I had to be in Newton before 7:00, so I didn't think this would be a problem.  However, daylight was quickly fading away as I drove to this cache and I was wondering whether I'd be able to find it easily or not.  SmtyColt called me as I was driving and (when the signal was clear) it sounded like I would be able to find it fairly easily.

Parked at the coordinates suggested in the hint (very handy...you might want to include those in the main text of the page, though) and made my way back to the cache.  Nice hide.  I really loved it!  Took the U.S. Flag patch and left a lighthouse pin and a really BIG deck of cards.

Met one of your relatives on the way back, Mudhen.  He even offered me a ride to my car, but since I knew I'd be eating a LOT of pizza within the hour I figured I could use the exercise. [:)]</groundspeak:text>

As we started from [I]Whistlin' II[/I] to this cache, we were greeted by mike_anderson1492, who somehow knew that we were geocachers [:I]. He gave us some hints about the upcoming cache and wished us well. 

We found the cache where we expected it, but couldn't open the log book, which was frozen solid -- so we signed a corner of the front page. TNLNSL. Thanks, sysop! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching with roelsch on a cold, windy, overcast, snowy, icy, and otherwise perfect day for caching.  We had just completed Whistlin' II and were on our way to this cache when an Olney park official approached us and asked us if we were geocachers.  It turned out to be mike_anderson1942.  He indicated that the cache might be missing and we said we would check on it.  The slight depression in the solid sheet of ice was the only evidence that a nice trail lead all the way to the cache.  We located it in the logical spot and headed back.  We ran into Mike again and explained that the cache was still there but that all the pages of the logbook were frozen together.  Roelsch and I had to sign on the first page.  We exchanged some geocaching “war stories” and then headed for the next cache.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.  Thanks, Sysop and Jack, for placing this cache.  – Mean Gene, St. Louis MO</groundspeak:text>

&lt;p&gt;We'll be meeting at &lt;b&gt;Cruisin' Time&lt;/b&gt; at 7:00 pm on Thursday, May 11th.  We will also be setting up some temporary caches in the area just to frustrate and amuse each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, visitors are welcome.  If you've just heard about Geocaching and are curious about what it's all about we'd love to give you the nickel tour.  Also, if you're interested in more information, be sure to check out our brochure which you can download &lt;a href="http://www.kandlelight.net/LEGSPamphlet.PDF"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HERE.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene in central Illinois on the chilly first weekend of February. We had a little more time in the area than we had originally figured on, so we stopped by the lovely town of Olney again for a short visit and a couple of caches. The sunshine that had been promised by the weather folks hadn't materialized yet, so we were looking while a light snow was blowing. After taking a couple of GPSr readings and reading the previous logs, we thought we knew where the cache might be -- and we were almost right. I spotted it from about 15 feet away as Mean Gene was only about two feet from it. TNLNSL. Thanks, whistlin' in the dark! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

We will probably never know if there was a better way to get to the cache site. There was a trail near the cache area, but we didn't know where it led so we went back the way we had come. I liked the stone railroad bridge (I think the keystone said 1883 on it) and thought, as we past it on our return, that maybe a good way to enter or exit might have been through its archway. TNLN.

Man I have been wanting to get down here and get this one for a long time so when i was in the area trying to get my 100 find, i thought why not. I had my wife with me and she didn’t want to get out when i told her it was a haunted cache, but she did and she is the one how found it. It wasn’t vary spooky during the day. I did have to try and knock on the door. I heard something, but it was real windy out, so i think it was just the wind.

We found the sign indicating that the entrance to the cache area was open, so we came on in and found two friendly faces at the end of the road to greet us. After exchanging brief pleasantries, we headed toward the cache, with The Rooter staying nearer the car. We found several areas that matched the cache description, but it was The Rooter who came up with the cache! TNLN. Thanks, HD-Dude!

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False"> Now a bit of history: Robert Ridgway, Leading American ornithologist, was born at Mount Carmel, Illinois on July 2, 1850. At the age of 17, he was appointed zoologist on a geological survey of the Fortieth Parallel. He wrote an authoritative 8 volume study of the Birds of North and Middle America Published between 1901 and 1919 with 2 additional volumes in preparation when he died. In 1916 Ridway retired to Olney to continue his research at his home which he called Larchmound. He developed an 18 acre tract here called Bird Haven as a Bird sanctuary and Experimental area for the Cultivation of trees and plants not native to the region. He died at Olney on March 25, 1929. Bird Haven with its variety of trees and birds remains as a memorial to this much-honored American Ormithologist. Ridgway's grave is marked by a big boulder on the trails. Please enjoys the trails and the walk throught Time.

This cache is a good Travel Bug site as it is located near the I-64 and I-57 Interchange.  One must exit off of I-64 and head to the Holiday Inn parking lot (rear).

PLEASE DO NOT PARK ON THE INTERSTATE TO OBTAIN THIS CACHE.

Cache is an Ammo Can and is about 15 yards from a parking area.

The name reflects the original location, but I moved it..

Enjoy!!

      <groundspeak:short_description html="False">To get to this cache take Rt. 37 to Bonnie, then turn onto Campground Road, this seems to turn into East Bonnie Road. Take this to Vermont Lane, and turn south onto Vermont Ln. At the curve in the road there is an waterfowl observation deck/tower/area. Look for the brown sign with the binoculars on it on your way in. I am pretty sure this is also accessable from the lake.</groundspeak:short_description>
      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">This cache is located near the waterfowl obsevation tower. This is a very nice place to observe Southern Illinois' wide variety of waterfowl and have a nice view of Rend Lake. In the summer bring a pole to fish with. In the fall be prepared to watch your migratory waterfowl at its best. (Geese etc.) This are is prone to flooding due to the lake and rain, but the cache should be safe from this. Almost all the contents of this cache I found in caches throughout Florida. Items include but not limited to: keychain, travel bug, pocket knife, hotweels car, coffee scoop, toy, coins, planner, garmin map cd, button, pin, magnet, ball, and much more. Please remember to sign the log. </groundspeak:long_description>
      <groundspeak:encoded_hints>Go south from the observation deck/tower. It is in a brush pile. It is easier if you go around, and don't cut through the weeds and brush.</groundspeak:encoded_hints>

A.  Our first stop is a small Graveyard on the side of a hill in the south part of the county.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

N 38° 51.743&lt;br&gt;
W088° 06.542&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's a nice clean little place to go visit "Joseph S. Clark." He was born in 18AA and died in 1925.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

B. Our second stop on our little journey is on the East Side of the county.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N 39° 01.468&lt;br&gt;
W087° 58.279&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

It's the Mound Cemetery where music legend Burl Ives is buried.  &lt;A HREF="http://eiuhalloffame.tripod.com/burlives/ivesmonument.html"&gt;Link here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Please stop and read his Monument. It's very nicely done.&lt;br&gt;
My Grandparents are also here on the east side.&lt;br&gt;
Today we come to visit “Sarah C. White” She was&lt;br&gt;
Born in 18BB and Died in 1928&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

C. Next we're off to the great northwest (hehehe part of the county). North of the small town of Gila.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N 39° 07.585&lt;br&gt;
W088° 15.636&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A very nice clean cemetery we come to visit "Barbara E. Clodfelder" She was born In 1CCC and Died in 1925&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

D. Now lets head off to the southwest. We won't find a desert but we will find the Headyvilly Christian church and Graveyard. It looks a lot like a picture.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N 38° 54.608&lt;br&gt;
W088° 20.515&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We've come here to visit Little "Mary E. Lister" She was only 5 years old when Jesus took her home. She died in 18DD . Her grave is under a big old cedar tree.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

E. OK - it's time to go to the River. High above Lovefort Bridge is where you'll find this one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
N 39° 03.194&lt;br&gt;
W088° 10.738&lt;br&gt;

We need to visit "Lydia H. Wall" She was Born in 1843 and Died in 19EE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After your visit you might like to take a walk. West there's a trail down the hill to the Old Lovefort Bridge. Then from the parking lot there’s a trail northwest to a river Overlook. Don't fall it’s a long way down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

F. Now we have one more visit before we get the cache. This is a special stop for me I make it often.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                                                          N 38° 58.849&lt;br&gt;
W088° 17.007&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now we need to visit my mother "Joyce E. Sparks" She was born in 1934 and Died in 2FFF .  She wasn't famous but she had lots of friends. If you can drop her a small purple flower. She would like that. Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now you should have all the numbers you need. The Cache is in a Modified Peanut Butter Jar at the base of a large tree near the fence.I have permission from the land owner to be here. I don't want to name what's in it because it will change with each find. I think I put some nice thing in to pick from. I hope you have as much fun hunting as I did staking it out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

We started working on this one on a previous trip and finished it up today. We interspersed waypoints of this cache with visits to other caches in the area, so it didn't seem like one long trip from one end of the county to the other and back. TNLNSL.

We started this cache with WP2 back in November of 2003.  Today we planned to combine the remaining waypoints with some other caches in the area.  Our planned sequence was WP3, WP5, WP6, WP4, WP1 and then the final cache.  As we made the rounds we realized that we could save some time and effort.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.

Four months and four days later....I'm done!

I started this multi on a nice, warm Saturday afternoon in August and finished it on a nice, warm Saturday afternoon in December.  In between that time I think there were two other trips where I gathered steps of this multi until today when I finally finished it!

This was fun.  I wouldn't want every multi to be like this, but I'm glad that some are!  And it was a great way to take in some local history.

Took one of the Ken Ham booklets (I really like Ken Ham...I also like canned ham....mmmmmmm) and I took the fossil lookin' thing.  Left a lighthouse pin, an Army issue P-38 and an am/fm radio that I won at a cache event some time back.

Thanks for the hide!</groundspeak:text>

So this one seemed perfect for a cold day; drive for awhile then look for clues, then drive and drive and drive somemore!  We saw some very interesting things today, that I never new existed before.  Finally finished at 5:00 pm in the dark.  Saw several deer just before getting out of the truck for the last one.  I have done many multi-caches before, but this one definitely covered the most miles.  Very cool multi, thanks Rome263!  TNLN

The cache container is the size of a pack of cigarettes.

There is a log book for you to sign, but here is the trick to successfully logging this cache:

You must log it by listing the serial number on the dollar bill which YOU take. 

Before spending the dollar bill, write "www.geocaching.com" somewhere on it.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Geocaching with Mean Gene in central Illinois on the chilly first weekend of February. This was our last cache of the day; we arrived about 10 minutes before sunset, collected an entourage of four hounds who seemed to enjoy going along for the hunt, and found the cache from the hint. TNLNSL.

Two of the dogs got bored, but the other two accompanied us back to the car, got a pat on the head, and headed back to their homes. Thanks, milosmycat &amp; xd_1999! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">Caching with roelsch on a cold, windy, overcast, snowy, icy, and otherwise perfect day for caching.  This was to be the last cache of a fun and productive day.  As we got out of the car we were approached by several barking dogs.  Two quickly realized that we were just geocachers and left.  The other two stuck around working up the courage to get close enough to get petted and get their ears rubbed.  The hiding place was not what I had visualized but the coordinates led us right to it.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.  Thanks, milosmycat &amp; xd_1999, for placing this cache.  – Mean Gene, St. Louis MO</groundspeak:text>

No problem with hunters.  My problem was finding the access point.  Tried to come in from the North, but the road was closed.  Coming in from the South, I couldn't find the recommended parking spot.  I parked on the other side of the road to the picnic area (gate was locked) and walked in.

Nice hike and a good find.
This was my third attempt, it seems the weekends are time for pheasent hunting in the area.  Too many guns going off in the woods makes me a bit uneasy, so I left it for a week day, and no problem.
While looking through the cache a big flock of geese flew over just above tree-top level.
Way cool!
Cache is in good shape, contents clean and dry.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">In Olney area for a day of caching with RGS. We are both from St. Louis. Came from ...J0Y cache and this was our last cache of the day. We really were walking fast on this one. We figured we had about 10 minutes to get there, find the cache and then get back to the car before we would be in darkness. Mission accomplished. I was really huffing and puffing by the time we got to the car. RGS was just breathing a 'little' harder. Thanks for the hide. TNLN. We had a good trip to the Olney area today and drove back to St. Louis with 21 finds.</groundspeak:text>

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">      This area  was bisected by the old Cahokia Trace, commonly known as the "Trace Road" which ran east and west just north of  what is now U. S. 50, and was for many years the principal route from historic Vincennes, Ind. to St. Louis and the west.

      This is the third and last cache in this park, it is located on the North side of the park. ( Which is on the north side of Illinois Route 50). 
      The Cache is located along  the Cahokia Trail. The Coords. takes you to a trail marker. From there you take a compass reading of  234 degrees SSW.  And go 75 feet to the cache. ( That's using my steps which is 2-1/2 ft. strides.)

      You may park at these Coords. located by the shelter house and bathrooms across from the youth camp grounds. N 38 44.048, W 087 50.199. There's a small walk to the trail head.  The trail is easy walking and clean.

There’s not much here. A cool tree and a couple picnic tables. Most people don’t even know it's here. Motorcycles there’s about 1 mile of rock. (SORRY) The Cache is in an Ice cream Bucket. The only first finder prize is getting to write your name first. (SORRY again.) There is stuff to trade. Happy Caching.

After trying to get to the cache from the North Marcum area I was confronted by gate after gate after gate after gate while looking for an easy access.  Since the North Marcum boat ramp was so far away from the cache, I drove to the South Marcum boat ramp.  I used my kayak on this fairly windy day.  I felt like I was on the ocean. TNLN

We drove all over the area trying to find the ball field, but had to settle for parking outside the barricaded city park and walking into the cache area. It was a very pleasant hike and a quick find. We did not visit the field of dreams since it was in the opposite direction as our entry to the park. TNLN. Thanks for a fun adventure. JL

The ditches were all full of snow when I hid this. They seem far deeper when you fall in the snow. The hiding place I planned to use had something frozen in it. So I had to look else were.&lt;/p&gt;
The Cache is a 35mm film can with a log scroll inside. It has a pencil inside also but you might want to take one yourself. There is also a first finder Prize. It was cold cash when I left it. If it got wet its probably cold hard cash by now.&lt;/p&gt;

The temperature wasn't too bad but the wind chill was pretty severe at times. Located the field, but after a quick appraisal of the mud situation, we decided to pass until another time.  But thanks for showing us this area.

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">As I was driving by looking for a place to park, I was thinking; where could a cache be hidden out there?  As I started walking, in the mud no less, I noticed a little creek and thought aha, but the GPSr was pointing in a different direction!  Kept walking all the while thinking I really screwed up the coordinates on this one!  But, did I stop, NO, I kept plugging along in the mud and as I closed in to 15' to the cache, there it was!  Right in the middle of a chiseled corn field in the open!  I was LOL the whole time I was signing the log.  Aside from all the mud, this has to be the easist cache ever!  However, if it is still here when the corn is 6' tall it would be a very different story.  Found it at 5:45pm, 3 for 3 of Rome263 caches for today.  Thanks Rome, I enjoyed them all.  When I was leaving, a guy in a pickup truck stopped thinking I found the antlers of a deer he had been tracking.  And speaking of tracking, the deer tracks I saw in the mud were the biggest I've ever seen.  There must be some really huge deer in these parts.  Anyway, I think the guy was relieved when I explained to him that I was geocaching and he just responded with that deer in the headlights look!  Tn, left Mean Gene Geocoin.

I was having trouble with a GPS signal due to the location, but I think it will get you close enough to find it. Let me know if you get something different.

The Cache is a modified Altoid container, so there’s not much room in the cache for goodies, but if you have something small it may fit.  Be sure to bring your own pen.


Cache Contains Log book (Bring your own pen), Longing for Steve Travel Bug, and a First Finder Prize

This was our first cache of the day, just over 100 miles from home, enroute to Oblong and back. Contrary to the forecast, the skies were overcast and there was light snow coming down when as we made our way to the cache. We found the fort, and had no problem finding the cache container, since it was sitting in the open, frozen to the ground. TNLNSL. Placed the cache back in about the same position, with some support to keep it from just rolling away with the ice thaws. Thanks, Matin67 and Trent96! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

The approach to the cache was solid ice and it took some doing to get to it.  Fortunately, the cache was sitting out in the open otherwise it would have been frozen in place.  We left it where we found it but it should be hidden after the ice melts.  Took nothing and left nothing.  Good job.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This cache is a modified Decon container stuffed with some goodies to trade.  This is a very old bridge that has been closed for several years.  If for some reason you find yourself on the wrong side DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE.  You must find another route, hence the name.  Signs abound that read "Do not cross" so please follow the rules.  Please watch your step when nabbing the cache, it's not a dangerous place, but you wouldn't want to lose your footing here.  Please make certain to snap the lid completley back on the container when you're done.  Among other trinkets for trade is the famous "Bogbuster" geocoin that I recently picked up.

Next to this bridge is a great place for an evening meal, make sure to order the Prime Rib!  :-)

This is a great location for some CITO.

Enjoy! - Scoobie

This one was just way to close to home for me to pass up.
I took a friend of mine on his first Geocaching adventure. Let him run the GPSr and he took us right to the spot. Of coarse we didn’t know we were in the right spot, but after a 5 or 6 min search, we located it.

Great job scoodie

I tend to agree with Doc, as this cache was found in the open again. Rehid the cache, as to maybe "Distress" a non-cacher in the future. Thanks for the hide.

The wind was picking up and it was a bit chilly, but the walk down the hill and across the bottoms was good for warming us up. Found the cache easily, then wondered whether there might just have been a shorter way in and out. TNLN. Thanks, smtycolt! -- roelsch, St. Charles, Mo.

Welcome to my first attempt at a micro-sized geocache.  

Cache is located in West Frankfort Community park.  Container is a 35mm film canister.  This is in an area of the park I frequent quite regularly- especially during the colder months!  If you see a red Miata or a blue Sentra nearby stop and say hi!    

Cache contains logbook and pencil- although you might want to bring a pen to make signing more comfortable.  </groundspeak:long_description>

I think we frightened the cleaning lady who pulled up right as we started to hunt.  She seemed to still be leary even after our explaination, but it's hard to be discrete with a group of 8 boys looking under bushes.  I hope we didn't cause too big of a problem.  TNLN.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I've always been intrigued with cachers who leave a signature item and/or calling card.  These  items are chosen carefully and designed with their owners persona and background in mind, thus providing the finder with a bit of insight to their personality.  I've created my own calling card that I leave along with my signature item, a DQ Coin (thanks to Carpe_Diem's wife, they are also known as  Scoobie snacks!).  I've enjoyed finding these treasures so much that I have started my own collection of signature items and calling cards that I've found along my caching way.  In order to add to that collection, I've created "Scoobie's Calling Card Cache"

When you visit, please leave your signature item and/or calling card so it can be added to my collection.  In turn, I've loaded up the cache with my cards and Scoobie snacks for you to hopefully add to your own collection.  Please let me know when either item gets low and I will be happy to refill it.  If you don't use cards or signature items.....no worries, you are still welcome to take my card and coin and log the cache.  Please only take my items and not the items of others. Please make sure to snap the lid completely back on the Decon container so it remains waterproof and bring your own pen.  I have been given permission from the park to place this cache. - Scoobie    ZOINKS! </groundspeak:long_description>

There is only one gravel road that leads to this cache and you must pull off to your right and park in a small grass clearing next to a field.  There is a house on the left side of the road and if you go as far as the house, you've gone too far.

I do have permission from the land owner to place the cache; however, cache hunters are not to go past the house that you will see on your left.

The cache is located at the bottom of a tree and about 30 - 40 up from the water.  You might run into some friendly dogs and if the time is right, deer.  Good luck!

We parked where you recommended and made the short hike around the lake. The cache was intact but in the open, uncovered. We used some geoflauge to cover it when we left. This is a very nice area, but we weren't sure what parts were private and what were public. Thanks for a fun adventure. JL

This cache is a round container approx. 4 inches long. The cache contains a log, Lewis and Clark Bead, Wine glass markers, keyring, first finders card and Quakerfarmer calling card.
P.S.
Crawford County is rich in oil history. Some of the first wells were discovered here. North of Flat Rock, Il. there is a oil lease that has one large gas engine that is used to power several oil well pumps. It is very interesting to watch and listen to this operation.</groundspeak:long_description>

Wow...it got a LOT colder between my last cache I found and this one!

Made my way around the park and parked the car.  I was a bit worried about making too many footprints around the cache location, but the snow was all pretty much turned to ICE by now, so that wasn't a problem.  However, making my way down the hill to the cache WAS a problem! [:P]

Nabbed the cache fairly quickly.  Took the army man.  Cool.  He's a smaller version of the same one I had left at a previous cache (the travelbug Stashing Private Ryan).  Left a lighthouse pin.  Thanks for the cache!</groundspeak:text>

I used to have nightmares about falling from this point where you can see the face.  That was then, now I don't mind the heights.  You should hike on around toward the South.  The view from the powerline point is nice, but on further you will see some nice views.</groundspeak:short_description>

We took a wrong turn at the bluff and walked along the base of the bluff at first, corrected our path and really enjoyed the views from the top this time of year(flowers in the spring are also great on top of the bluff). Contents of cache are in great shape. We took travel bug, $1.00 and railroad key chain. We left 2 where's george dollars, Garmin poker chip, and a Dippin Dots tattoo.

I grew up in So. Il, and visited Stone Face many times over the years.  Seemed much smaller this time, probably due to the fact that the last time I was there I was much smaller.

This was our fourth stop but only second cache, furthest from home, of the day. Not surprisingly, we had the park to ourselves as we slid in the car on the road circling the lake, and over the dam. 

Our two GPSrs had a significant difference of opinion, so we wandered around in separate circles for a bit. Mean Gene re-read the clues and notes aloud as I rooted and, sure enough, found the cache just as he finished reading. TNLNSL. Thanks, ZBQ! roelsch -- St. Charles, MO.

Then enjoyed a nice hike down the trails through the wetlands. Located the cache, although it was pretty muddy off the trail. The lid on the cache is cracked and the contents soaked. Managed to sign the logbook although it may be more of an indentation than ink on paper. Thanks for bringing us to this area. JL

      <groundspeak:long_description html="False">I used to run around this area so I decided to place a cache here.

A lot of people use this area to place canoes in the river. It is also pretty good for fishing. So bring your equipment and enjoy the day.

The container is an Altoids Breath Strip so it may take some hunting to find it. Please no spoilers in the logs.

Enjoy

          <groundspeak:text encoded="False">This was a fun find it took a little work but it was worth it. It’s a nice place to put in the river to canon down to Newton. Watch the Concrete that’s under the bridge and don’t sprang your ankle.

Thanks Carpe_Diem

This is a Virtual Cache. Your mission will be to retrieve the password.

      <groundspeak:long_description html="True">This structure was sponsored by the St. Anthony's Catholic Church. 
&lt;p&gt;
When standing at the structure, face North and look for a freeway exit sign. The name of the town on the exit sign will be your password (case sensitive) to open the (Word Document "Certificate of Accomplishment". A URL will be included so you can learn more about this location.
&lt;P&gt;
Enjoy and God Bless.

BTW. When you turn the corner and this comes into view you will understand the title.  It is the first words out of my son's mouth on our way back from a 'Just Passing Through"  cache hunt.
