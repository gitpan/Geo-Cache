        use Geo::Cache;
        my $wpt = Geo::Cache->new(
            lat  => '37.99815',
            lon  => '-85.302017',

        $wpt->url('http://www.geocaching.com/');

        my $wpt_from_xml = Geo::Cache->new( xml => $xml, );

        my $xml = $wpt->xml;

        use Geo::Gpx;
        my $gpx = Geo::Gpx->new( @waypoints );
        my $xml = $gpx->gpx;
        my $loc = $gpx->loc;

DESCRIPTION

    Provide an object interface to Geocaching.com waypoints and/or
    geocaches, using the Groundspeak GPX file as the reference for what
    fields are valid.

    Methods are provide for various of the fields that require special
    treatment.

    The Geo::GPX module allows you to accumulate multiple waypoints, and
    output the various file formats that are in use for these waypoints.
    This currently includes GPX, Loc, and GPSDrive files. The first two
    are generally associated with the Geocaching.com website. The
    GPSDrive format is for use in the GPSDrive program. More
    instructions for each will accompany some future version of this
    module.
